# üìô UCI Schedule of Classes WebSOC API

üéâ A more elegant way of reading UCI's schedule of classes, presented to you in JSON!

This API is live, and published to [https://uci-websoc.jasonho.workers.dev/](https://uci-websoc.jasonho.workers.dev/), and powered by Cloudflare Workers, it should be up for as long as I have a Cloudflare account and have quota to use.

## Usage

`GET` [https://uci-websoc.jasonho.workers.dev/](https://uci-websoc.jasonho.workers.dev/)
Shows quick information about the current API versioning and status.

`GET` [https://uci-websoc.jasonho.workers.dev/options](https://uci-websoc.jasonho.workers.dev/options)
Shows the options that can be passed via JSON (using `application/json`) to /query for course listings.

`GET` [https://uci-websoc.jasonho.workers.dev/options/your_param](https://uci-websoc.jasonho.workers.dev/options/)
For every option under `preset` in `/query`, these have values that are pre-set and can be retrieved using `/query/<preset>` such as `/query/YearTerm`.
**Note:** This is case sensitive.

`POST` [https://uci-websoc.jasonho.workers.dev/query](https://uci-websoc.jasonho.workers.dev/query)
To query the WebSoc and return it in JSON, send a POST request with a JSON body with your query parameters.
**Note:** Keys are case insensitive unlike `/options`

`POST` [https://uci-websoc.jasonho.workers.dev/courses](https://uci-websoc.jasonho.workers.dev/courses)
To query the WebSoc and return just the courses available and their details.
**Note:** Keys are case insensitive unlike `/options`

# More Notes
This API has enabled Cross Origin requests, so feel free to use this in your project. However, if this API's return status indicates it is out of requests, please feel free to deploy this on your own Cloudflare Account!
